    <title>1993 Cars</title>
</head>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>Cars were selected at random from among 1993 passenger car models that were listed in both the <em>Consumer Reports</em> issue and the <em>PACE Buying Guide</em>. Pickup trucks and Sport/Utility vehicles were eliminated due to incomplete information in the <em>Consumer Reports</em> source.  Duplicate models (e.g., Dodge Shadow and Plymouth Sundance) were listed once. The only missing values are for <strong>Cylinders</strong> in the rotary engine Mazda RX-7, and <strong>RearRoom</strong> for the two-seaters (Corvette and RX-7).</p>

<p>Further description can be found in the "Datasets and Stories" article "1993 New Car Data" in the <em>Journal of Statistics Education</em> (Lock 1993).</p>
