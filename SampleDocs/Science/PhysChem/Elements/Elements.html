    <title>Elements</title>
</head>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>This case table gives you information about all of the elements of the periodic table. Check out the table and graph and see what you can learn about them!</p>

<h5>Examine the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out the atomic number of Oxygen?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph provided and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table? Can you tell what the density of that element is?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. Can you tell what chemical series the element belongs to?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>

<h5>Attribute Key</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Name</strong> = Element name</li>
    <li><strong>Symbol</strong> = Element Abbreviation</li>
    <li><strong>Table_Row</strong> = Row in periodic table (see Note)</li>
    <li><strong>Table_Column</strong> = Column in periodic table</li>
    <li><strong>Chemical_Series</strong> = Element type</li>
    <li><strong>AtomicNumber</strong> = Equal to the number of protons in the nucleus</li>
    <li><strong>AtomicWeight</strong> = Atomic weight</li>
    <li><strong>Atomic Radius</strong> = Distance from nucleus to outermost stable electron orbit</li>
    <li><strong>Density</strong> Density at 1 atm and room temperature</li>
    <li><strong>NaturalState</strong> State at room temperature</li>
    <li><strong>BoilingPoint</strong> = Temperature to boil
    <li><strong>MeltingPoint</strong> = Temperature to melt</li>
    <li><strong>ThermalConductivity</strong> = A measure of the ability of the material to conduct heat</li>
    <li><strong>SpecificHeat</strong> = A measure of the amount of energy to raise the temperature of a specified amount of the material by 1C</li>
    <li><strong>Electron Affinity</strong> = The energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion</li>
    <li><strong>Ionization Energy</strong> = The energy needed to remove an electron from a neutral atom</li>
    <li><strong>NumberOfIsotopes</strong> = The number of isotopes of the element identified</li>
    <li><strong>Classification</strong> = Type of element</li>
    <li><strong>Year_Discovered</strong> = Year of discovery</li>
    <li><strong>Discoverer</strong> = Person credited for discovery</li>
    <li><strong>Cost</strong> = Cost in dollars/gram</li>
    <li><strong>NaturalForming</strong> = Occurring in nature</li>
    <li><strong>PrimaryUse</strong> = Primary use</li>
</ul>

<h5>Questions:</h5>
<ol>
    <li>During what time periods were scientist most successful at identifying "new" elements, ones that had not yet been discovered? (You might want to create a new graph to visualize this)</li>
    <li>Describe the changes over the years in the types of elements (e.g., natural state, naturally forming) being discovered at a particular time.</li>
</ol>
