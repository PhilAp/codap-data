<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<body>
<p>Imagine you put 500 mL of water in a saucepan and put it on your stove. At time zero, you turned the stove on high. Then, from time to time, you recorded the time and the temperature of the water. When the water boiled, you turned the stove off.</p>

<h5>Attribute Key</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>time_m</strong> = the minute part of the time since you took the starting temperature</li>
    <li><strong>time_s</strong> = the second part of the time since you took the starting temperature</li>
    <li><strong>temp</strong> = water temperature in degrees Celsius</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<p>This case table shows the 33 recordings you made while the water was boiling. Make a graph and see what you can learn from it and the table!</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
