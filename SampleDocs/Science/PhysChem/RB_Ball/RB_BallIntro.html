<h5>Background</h5>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over the year from Fall, 1998 to Fall, 1999, I collected rubber bands from the daily newspaper and various other sources, adding each new rubber band to an expanding ball. Members of my family also removed rubber bands as needed, but, on the average, the ball grew.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In November, 1999, Jill Binker and I began to take measurements of the ball as we removed rubber bands from it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before we started we asked people in our office to guess how many rubber bands were in the ball:</p>

<dl class="description_list" style="list-style-type:none">
    <dt>Bill: 500</dt>
    <dt>Jill:230</dt>
    <dt>Sharon:325</dt>
    <dt>Matt:500</dt>
    <dt>Nick: 250</dt>
    <dt>Kirk: 225</dt>
    <dt>Keith: 600</dt>
    <dt>Scott: 700</dt>
</dl>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I worked with Jill for the first 27 measurements, then with my daughter Lauren for the next 21 measurements, and the remainder I did on my own.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We removed 5 rubber bands at a time. For each number removed, we made three measurements: the weight in grams using a very sensitive triple beam balance, the diameter in inches using a vernier calipers, and position along a tape measure for the maximum height of a bounce when dropped from 72 inches onto a concrete floor.</p>

<h5>Procedure</h5>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The procedure was to remove rubber bands; weigh three times; measure diameter three times; and measure bounce position three times. We worked in pairs and took turns measuring. To measure the bounce height we taped a carpenter's measuring tape against the wall on the porch. The length of the tape is 72 inches with the tape case on the cement. One person dropped the ball on the count of 3 and the other person caught it at its maximum bounce height. There was a great deal of variability in the process partly because the ball's surface was fairly irregular and partly because we there is no way to get the ball exactly at its peak or move it exactly perpendicular towards the tape.</p>
