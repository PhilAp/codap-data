    <title>Rubber Band Ball Measurements</title>
</head>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>
<p>After reading about the experiment in the Introduction, check out the table and graph and see what you can find out!</p>

<p>Examine the table and graph:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the tale. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out how many rubber bands had been removed when the diameter was 21.5 centimeters for BL?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table? Can you tell from the table what the elasticity of the ball was?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. Can you tell what the weight of the rubber band ball was at that diameter?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
