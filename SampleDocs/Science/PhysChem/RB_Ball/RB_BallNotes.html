    <title>Rubber Band Ball Measurements</title>
</head>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<body>

<h5>Data gathering observations:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>The initial size of the ball was such that it barely fit within the jaws of the calipers.</li>
    <li>Getting a bounce measure was a chancy process because the distance of the ball to the wall would vary, so the process of bringing the ball to the tape was inexact.</li>
    <li>Rubber bands removed from near the center of the ball showed their age; i.e. they pealed off in a funny way and were highly cracked.</li>
    <li>Lauren and I repeated the measurements for 40 rubber bands removed to see if they were consistent with the previous measurements made a month earlier.</li>
</ul>
