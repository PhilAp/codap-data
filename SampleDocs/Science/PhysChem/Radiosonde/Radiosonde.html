<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>These data were gathered during a weather balloon ascent. Check out the table and graph to see what you can learn from them!</p>

<h5>Attribute Key</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>time</strong> = time in seconds from launch</li>
    <li><strong>height</strong> = meters above sea level</li>
    <li><strong>pressure</strong> = pressure in millibars</li>
    <li><strong>tempC</strong> = temperature in degrees Celsius</li>
    <li><strong>dewpointC</strong> = dew point in degrees Celsius</li>
    <li><strong>waterDensity</strong> = water density in grams per cubic meter</li>
    <li><strong>humidity</strong> = percent of relative humidity</li>
    <li><strong>wind</strong> = wind speed in meters per second</li>
    <li><strong>windDegrees</strong> = wind direction degrees, <strong>e.g. North = 0 and East = 90</strong></li>
</ul>

<h5>Examine the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the dew point of the the weather balloon was after 51 seconds of its ascent?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table? Can you tell what the percent of humidity for that data point is?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot. Can you tell what the pressure at that height was?</li>
    <li>Looking at the graph as a whole, can you see a relationship between the height of the weather balloon and the amount of time it has been ascending?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
