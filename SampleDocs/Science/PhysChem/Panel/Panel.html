    <title>Solar Panel Readings</title>
</head>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>Chris Olsen of Fathom's young daughter did a project with a solar panel. Check out the table and graphs to see what you can find out!</p>

<h5>Examine the table and graphs:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you gather from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out which light had the temperature of 98.4 degrees Celsius?</li>
    <li>Look in the <strong>top</strong> graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the other graphs and table? Can you tell the amount of power that light had?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the top graph. Can you tell what the voltage of that light was?</li>
    <li>Are there any relationships you seen in the data?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Attribute Key</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Light</strong> = light number</li>
    <li><strong>Current(A)</strong> = the measure of the current in Amperes</li>
    <li><strong>Voltage (V)</strong> = the measure of voltage in volts</li>
    <li><strong>Temperature (degF)</strong> = the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit</li>
    <li><strong>power</strong> = the measure of power in watts</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
