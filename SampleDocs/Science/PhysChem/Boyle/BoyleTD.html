    <title>Boyle's Pressure Vs. Volume Experiment</title>
</head>
<h2>To Do</h2>
<body>

<p>This case table shows the results of Charles Boyle's experiment about the relationship between pressure and volume. Check out the table and graph to see what you can learn about it.</p>

<h5>Examine the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the height of the mercurial cylinder in the longer leg was when the number of equal air spaces in the shorter leg was 40?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. Can you tell what the predicted pressure according to the hypothesis was for that dot?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. What information can you gather from from this action?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
