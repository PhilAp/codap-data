<p>The notes beneath it read as follows:</p>
<p>"For the better understanding of this experiment, it may not be amiss to take notice of the following particulars:</p>

<ul>
    <li>That the tube being so tall, that we could not conveniently make use of it in a chamber, we were fain to use it on a pair of stairs, which yet were very lightsome, the tube being for preservation's sake by strings so suspended, that it did scarce touch the box presently to be mentioned.</li>
    <li>The lower and crooked part of the pipe was placed in a square wooden box, of a good largeness and depth, to prevent the loss of the quicksilver, that might fall aside in the transfusion from the vessel into the pipe, and to receive the whole quicksilver in case the tube should break.</li>
    <li>That we were two to make the observation together, the one to take notice at the bottom, how the quicksilver rose in the shorter cylinder, and the other to pour in at the top of the longer; it being very hard and troublesome for one man alone to do both accurately.</li>
    <li>That the quicksilver was poured in but by little and little, according to the direction of him that observed below; it being far easier to pour in more, than to take out any, in case too much at once had been poured in."</li>
</ul>
