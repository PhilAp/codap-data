<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>This case table shows the data of Charles Boyle's Pressure vs. Volume Experiment in 1662.</p>

<h5>Attribute Key</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>A_ShorterLeg</strong> - The number of equal spaces in the shorter leg, that contained the same parcal of air diversely extended.</li>
    <li><strong>B_HgHeight</strong> - The height of the mercurial cylinder in the longer leg, that compressed the air into those dimensions.</li>
    <li><strong>C_HgHtToBalanceAtmosphere</strong> - The height of the mercurial cylinder that counter-balanced the pressure of the atmosphere.</li>
    <li><strong>D_HgTotalHt</strong> - The Aggregate of the last columns B and C, exhibiting the pressure sustained by the included air.</li>
    <li><strong>E_PredictedHt</strong> - What that pressure should be according to the hypothesis, that supposes the pressures and expansions to be in reciprocal proportions.</li>
</ul>
