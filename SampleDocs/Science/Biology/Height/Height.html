<h1>Height Over Time</h1>
<body>
<p>Heights at different times of the day for several subjects (ages between 20 and 25). They had their heights measured at different times during the day. Each case is a measurement.</p>

<h5>Attribute Key:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Subject</strong> = The number of the subject.</li>
    <li><strong>Sex</strong> = The sex of the subject.</li>
    <li><strong>Time_hrs</strong> = The time of day in the 24-hr format with decimals (ex. 8:45 PM is seen in the table as 20.75). An entry larger than 24.00 indicates a time after midnight, but before the subject went to bed.</li>
    <li>Height_m: height, in meters.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph icon.</strong></li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
