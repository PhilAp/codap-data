<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<body>
<p>143 wild bears were anesthetized, and their bodies were measured and weighed. One goal of the study was to make a table (or perhaps a set of tables) for hunters, so they could estimate the weight of a bear based on other measurements. This would be used because in the forest it is easier to measure the length of a bear, for example, than it is to weigh it.</p>

<p>The data are supplied with MiniTab and are attributed to Dr. Gary Alt.</p>
