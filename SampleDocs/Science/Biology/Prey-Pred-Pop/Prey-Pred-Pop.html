    <title>Prey to Predator Populations</title>
</head>
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<body>

<p>Here is data of a simulated ecosystem containing predators and their prey. It shows the population of each over time.</p>

<h5>Examine the table and graphs:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the population of prey was in the fifth year?</li>
    <li>Look in the left graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the other graph? Can you tell from the graph on the right the amount of predator deaths there were at that predator population?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph icon.</strong></li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
