<p>The Midge Problem</p>
<p>In 1981, two new varieties of a tiny biting insect called a midge were discovered by biologists W. L. Grogan and W. W. Wirth in the jungles of Brazil. They dubbed one kind of midge an Apf midge and the other an Af midge. The biologists found out that the Apf midge is a carrier of a debilitating disease that causes swelling of the brain when a human is bitten by an infected midge. Although the disease is rarely fatal, the disability caused by the swelling may be permanent. The other form of the midge, the Af, is quite harmless and a valuable pollinator. In an effort to distinguish the two varieties, the biologist took measurements on the midges they caught.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Is it possible to distinguish an Af midge from an Apf midge on the basis of wing and antenna length?</li>
        <li>Write a report that describes to a naturalist in the field how to classify a midge he or she has just captured.</li>
</ol>

<h5>Attribute Key</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Midge</strong> = The kind of midge being observed. Here, one kind is called <strong>"Af"</strong> and the other is called <strong>"Apf"</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>WL</strong> = The measurement of the widge's wing length in centimeters.</li>
    <li><strong>AL</strong> = The measurement of the widge's antennae length in centimeters.</li>
</ul>
