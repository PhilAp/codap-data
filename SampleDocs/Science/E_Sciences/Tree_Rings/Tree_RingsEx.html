<h2>Explore</h2>
<body>

<h5>Explore the tables and graphs:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the tables. What information can you get from each table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the January mid temperature was in 1899?</li>
    <li>Look in the leftmost graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the case table associated with it? What is the denominator of the measure of the ring?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the same graph. What information is shown there? Can you tell what the complete measure in inches from the zero point that ring is?</li>
    <li><strong>Think about it:</strong> Is there any relationship between the growth of the tree and historical weather?</li>
</ul>


<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
