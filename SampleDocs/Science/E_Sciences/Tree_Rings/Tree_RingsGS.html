    <title>Tree Rings</title>
</head>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>A huge pine was felled near a house in the hills above Santa Cruz. A photo of the sliced trunk revealed about 150 rings in total. Since the tree came down in the year 2005, this would put the birth year of the tree to be about 1855. While measuring the distances of the rings at a very high resolution, three values were recorded: the whole number of inches, the numerator of the fractional inches, and the denominator of the fractional inches.</p>

<p>The choice of a zero point was arbitrary, and is about 20 rings from the center of the tree.</p>

<p>The case table to the far left shows you the ring number and the rings' measurements beginning in the estimated year of 1883 to the estimated year of 1969. The middle table informs you about the high, mid, and low temperatures of each month for every year starting at 1897 until 1930. In the final case table, there is historical data for precipitation from the years 1878 to 2003.</p>

<h5>Attribute Key:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>nRing</strong> = the number of the ring</li>
    <li><strong>Est_Year</strong> = the estimated year of the recorded measurements</li>
    <li><strong>distIn</strong> = the distance in whole inches between the zero point and the ring</li>
    <li><strong>num</strong> = the numerator of the fractional inches of distance from the zero point and the ring</li>
    <li><strong>denom</strong> = the denominator of the fractional inches of distance from the zero poing and the ring</li>
    <li><strong>R</strong> = the distance in whole inches and the numerator over the denominator in inches</li>
    <li><strong>Rafall</strong> = the amount of rainfall during the year the ring was formed</li>
    <li><strong>Temp</strong> = the temperature during the year the ring was formed</li>
    <li><strong>*month*Hi</strong> = the highest temperature recorded during that month</li>
    <li><strong>*month*Mid</strong> = the mid temperature recorded during that month</li>
    <li><strong>*month*Lo</strong> = the lowest temperature recorded during that month</li>
    <li><strong>AnnualMidAv</strong> = the average mid temperature of each year</li>
    <li><strong>Annual</strong> = the amount of precipitation during that year</li>
</ul>
