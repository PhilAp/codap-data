<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find from them?</li>
    <li>Can you find out which year had the lowest average annual temperature of the first ten listed in the table?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table? Can you tell from the table what the elevation of that station is?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. What information does it show you? What is the annual average temperature for that station?</li>
    <li><strong>Think about it:</strong> Look for effects of latitude, elevation, longitude, and year. Were there weather events that affected more than one part of the state? Can you detect global warming?</li>
</ul>
