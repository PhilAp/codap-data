    <title>Global Carbon Emissions</title>
</head>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>
<p>This case table contains yearly carbon dioxide emissions from various sources around the world. Carbon dioxide emissions are the measure of how much carbon dioxide humans put into the atmosphere, as opposed to how much is naturally found there.</p>

<p><em>Please note that annual sums were tallied before each element was rounded, so totals may differ slightly from the sum of the elements due to rounding.</em></p>

<h5>Attribute Key:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Year</strong> = calendar year</li>
    <li><strong>Total</strong> = total CO2 emissions in million metric tons of carbon</li>
    <li><strong>Gas</strong> = total CO2 emissions fom gas in million metric tons of carbon</li>
    <li><strong>Liquid</strong> = total CO2 emissions from liquid in million metric tons of carbon</li>
    <li><strong>Solid</strong> = total CO2 emissions from solids in million metric tons of carbon</li>
    <li><strong>Cement</strong> = total CO2 emissions from cement in million metric tons of carbon</li>
    <li><strong>Flaring</strong> = total CO2 emissions from flaring in million metric tons of carbon</li>
    <li><strong>PerCapita</strong> = per capita CO2 emissions in metric tons of carbon per person, per year</li>
</ul>

<h5>Explore:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what year the total CO2 emissions from liquid was 504 million metric tons of carbon?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table? Can you tell from the table what the total CO2 emissions from cement was for that year?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot. What was the total CO2 emissions in metric tons per capita for that year?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
