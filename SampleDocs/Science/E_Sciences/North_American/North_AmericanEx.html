<h2>Explore!</h2>

<h5>Check out the table and graphs:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out when the highest magnitude earthquake was recorded?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph to the right of the table and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table and the other graph? Can you tell from a graph what year that earthquake occurred?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. Can you tell what the latitude and longitude of that earthquake was?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>

<h5>Some more things to think about...</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Does the distribution of magnitudes make sense?</li>
    <li>Look at the intervals between earthquakes. Can you show that they are or are not consistent with independence?</li>
</ol>
