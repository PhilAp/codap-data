<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>

    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find in the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the mean dew point was on 1/5/2006.</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. Can you tell what the mean sea level pressure was for that day of the year?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
