    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see?</li>
    <li>Is there a relationship between the vertical acceleration of the earthquake and the amount of time that has passed?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
