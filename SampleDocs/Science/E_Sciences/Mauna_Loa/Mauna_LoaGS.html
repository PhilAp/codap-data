<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>From 1958 to 2010, the levels of CO2 in parts per million were recorded. Parts per million can also be equally measured 1:1 in milligrams per litre, so for ease of understanding in this activity, we will be expressing CO2 levels in milligrams per litre (mg/L).</p>

<h5>Attribute Key:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>year</strong> = year the data was taken</li>
    <li><strong>month</strong> = month the data was taken</li>
    <li><strong>year_dec</strong> = decimal year the data was taken</li>
    <li><strong>CO2</strong> = amount of CO2 in mg/L</li>
    <li><strong>season_adj</strong> = CO2 levels adjusted for the season</li>
</ul>
