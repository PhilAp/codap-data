<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>This case table gives the sunspot number for a random sample of 2000 days since 1951. You can find a definition of the sunspot number (<em>which is not the number of sunspots!</em>) at http://www.spaceweather.com/.</p>
<p>To break down the equation used, <strong>R = k(10g+s)</strong>, where <strong>k</strong> is a scaling factor, <strong>g</strong> is the number of sunspot groups, and <strong>s</strong> is the total number of sunspots in all of the groups. A <em>scaling factor</em> is a factor that multiplies, or scales, a quantity.</p>
<h5>Explore:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
<li>Can you find out what the largest sunspot in all of the Octobers were?</li>
<li>Look in the top graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see on the other graphs? Can you tell from a graph which month that dot was recorded?</li>
</ul>
<h5>Create your own graph</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon. What do you think those dots represent.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the y-axis attribute and the x-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from your graph's axis, click on the desired axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
<h5>Attributes:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>year = year</li>
    <li>mo = month</li>
    <li>day = day</li>
    <li>decyear = decimal year (used for time)</li>
    <li>R = sunspot number</li>
</ul>
