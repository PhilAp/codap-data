<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>Jupiter's radius as measured in arcseconds from Earth varies considerably depending on how far the planet is from Earth.</p>
<p>Explain the plot of <strong>radius</strong> versus <strong>mjd</strong> mean Julian date).</p>
<p>Knowing that an arc second is 1/60 of an arc minute and an arc minute is 1/60 of a degree, and the radius of Jupiter is 71.4x10^6 meters, compute a distance from Earth attribute. Is the Earth ever closer to Jupiter than it is to the sun?</p>

<h5>ATTRIBUTES</h5>
<ul>
    <li>mdj: mean Julian date. It is measured in days from 17 November 1858.</li>
    <li>radius: the apparent equatorial radius of Jupiter in arc seconds. One arc second is 1/60 of an arc minute, and an arc minute is 1/60 of a degree. So an arc second is small. There are 206, 265 of them in a radian.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a sample of 100 days from the period 1 January 2000 to 1 January 2002.</p>
<p>The data are from http://rinside.arc.nasa.gov/www/tools/ephem_jup.html</p>
