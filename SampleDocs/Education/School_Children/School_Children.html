<h3>Introduction</h3>
<ul>
    <li>These are data of about 236 schoolchildren. Each child is represented by a dot in one of the graphs.</li>
    <li>Click on a dot. Notice that the child's data is highlighted in the table on the left.</li>
    </li>
    <li>Try coloring the points by "age." Drag the "age" attribute into the center of the graph to create a legend. You
        will see that the older the child, the darker the dot. Click on one of the
        darker icons to see information about that child in the table.
    </li>
    <!--<li>Drag the "sex" attribute into the center of the graph window. Notice that the females are purple, and the males-->
    <!--are orange.-->
    <!--</li>-->
    <li>To see how tall each child is, select the Height attribute. Drag it to the horizontal (x) axis. This
        distribution is interesting. The data cluster in two places, around 61. Click on the "sex"
        attribute, and put it in the center of the graph.
    </li>
    <li>We can separate the males and females by plotting "sex" on the vertical axis of the graph.
    </li>
    <li>Click on the ruler icon, and select "mean" to see the location of the mean. A "movable value" is helpful to
        read off precise values.
    </li>
    <li>You can adjust the size of the points to make them very large or very small.</li>
    <li>This should be enough to get you started. Don't be afraid to mess around and see what happens. To return to a
        previous plot, you can use the "undo" command in the menu.
    </li>
</ul>
<P>This data comes from Lewis and Taylor (1967).</p>
