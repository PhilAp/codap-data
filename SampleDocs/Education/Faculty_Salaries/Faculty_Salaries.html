<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>This data includes salaries of college faculty in the 2002–2003 academic year. It provides aggregate information for
    each institution. Play around with the data by hovering over the column headings (attributes) in the table to
    discover
    more about your data set. You can use CODAP to make group comparisons.</p>

<h3>Occupational Data</h3>
<p>Here we have information from 1,330 institutions about faculty salaries, including the state, job title, and
    category.
    Look at the graph created for Professor salaries in thousands of dollars per year. The graph is skewed right, so
    that
    the majority of people are on the lower end. Notice that four groups have been made for each category institution.
    The graph can help us see whether people who work in doctoral institutions make more money than people who work in 2
    year institutions.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Click on the ruler menu. Select “Standard Deviation.” What conclusions can you make about the data?</li>
    <li>To change the data displayed in the map, drag a different column header from the table to the map. What do you
        think the different shades on the map mean?
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Graph</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Try dragging a job title into the horizontal axis and see what happens.</li>
<li>The graph is a series of histograms that represent the salary levels of professor jobs at various institution
categories. What institutions, on average, generate the highest salary earnings? The lowest? Are there states where an
Instructor or Assistant Professor would do better to start a career?</li>
<li>Play around with the graph by placing attributes on both the horizontal and vertical axes to see what you discover. You
can either replace an attribute by dragging another into the yellow space in the graph.</li>
<li>Alternatively if you want to change something in the graph, you can click on the label and a menu of attributes will
appear. You can select from that menu and watch the data move around.</li>
<li>What sense are you making of these data? What discoveries and what questions do you have?</li>
</ul>
