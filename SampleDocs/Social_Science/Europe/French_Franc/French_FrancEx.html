<p>This case table contains information about the value of the French Franc in comparison to the European Euro in 2003. The purchasing power of the euro and the French franc measures monetary erosion due to inflation. The deflator used by the experts for each year is the annual average of the published general price index, which covers the broadest population aggregate. We take the index for all urban households whose head is a manual or non-manual employee through to 1992 and the index for all households in mainland France as of 1993, when it was first published. Starting in January 1999, the index used in the table covers all households in mainland France and the French overseas departments.</p>
