<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find in the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what kinds of products Canada exports? Do they export similar products as where you live? (You may have to look up information about this)</li>
    <li>Click on one of the dots in the graph. What happens in the table? What other information can you learn about the dot from the table?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot. What information is displayed?</li>
    <li>Which types of exports are on the increase for different time periods?</li>
    <li><strong>Think about it:</strong> &nbsp Can you see the impact of specific trade deals that Canada has made with other countries, such as NAFTA or the Canada-USA Trade Agreement? Is there any impact from cross-border trade issues (e.g. soft wood lumber) or world events (9/11)?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
    <li>To color the graph according to an attribute, drag the desired attribute to the middle of the graph into the orange rectangle. Try different attributes. Is there a trend?</li>
</ul>
