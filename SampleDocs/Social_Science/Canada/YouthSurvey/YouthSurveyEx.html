<p>This case table provides you with data obtained from the Ontario Youth (aged 10-13 years) in a survey conducted as part of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY)conducted between 1994 and 1999. There are 19 attributes for 1046 Ontario students. As is the case for many surveys, attributes are mainly categorical, since they are based on discrete responses. The last three attributes are digital.</p>
