<p>Under the federal government's "Brighter Futures" initiative, Human Resources Development Canada (HRDC) is responsible for the "What Works for Children - Information Development Program". As part of this program, HRDC and Statistics Canada have developed the National Longitudinal Survey of Children (NLSC). The survey's purpose is to develop information for policy analysis and program development on critical factors affecting the development of children in Canada</p>

<p>A series of research papers based on Cycle 1 of the NLSCY was presented at the conference sponsored by Human Resources Development Canada in 1998; for more information, visit the <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/rdc/proje_nlscy" target="_blank_parent">website</a>.</p>
