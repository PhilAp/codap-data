<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>Remove an attribute on an axis by clicking on the axis label and selecting <strong>"Remove X"</strong> or <strong>"Remove Y."</strong> You can also <em>replace</em> it by dragging the new attribute on top of the old one.</li>
    <li>Color the data in the graph by dragging an attribute into the orange rectangle in the center of it.</li>
    <li>Play around with different attributes in the graph and see the relationships!</li>
</ul>
