<p>This case table contains information about the Scholastic Assessment Test score averages, by state, from 1987-88 to 2001-02. <strong>"V"</strong> stands for Verbal, and <strong>"M"</strong> stands for Math.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> &nbsp; Scholastic Assessment Test was formerly known as the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  Percentage of graduates taking the SAT is based on the projection of high school graduates by the Western Interstate Commission for  Higher Education, and number of students in the
    graduating class who took the SAT I: Reasoning Test. Possible scores on each part of the SAT range from 200 to 800.  Rankings of states
    based on SAT scores alone are invalid because of the varying proportions of students in each state taking the tests.</p>
