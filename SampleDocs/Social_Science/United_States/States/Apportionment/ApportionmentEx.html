<p>This case table contains information about the proportion of state representatives there were to the population of each state in the year 2000.  Some of the attributes are explained below.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: &nbsp; The "census" pop and the "apportionment" pop are not the same. Check out the website to investigate this; Tim thinks that it's because of the way they count people currently living elsewhere (esp overseas). For apportionment purposes, they count in their "original" state. </p>

<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find in the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out which state had the largest population in the year 1990?</li>
    <li>Click on one of the dots in the graph. What happens in the table?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. What information is displayed in the box that appears?<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<h5>Think about it:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>What statements can you make based on the data shown? Is there a trend? Are there any relationships?</li>
    <li>How many people does it take to get a representative? Which state's representatives give their constituents the most electoral "leverage", i.e., the fewest people per rep?</li>
    <li>Which state grew the most in the decade? Does it matter whether that's percentage or absolute? If two states switch rank in population, what does that look like on the scatter plot? (See NY and TX)</li>
</ul>

<h5>Attribute Key</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AppPop2000</strong> = Apportionment population 2000</li>
    <li><strong>reps2000</strong> = number of reps in congress based on the 2000 Census</li>
    <li><strong>dreps</strong> = change in that number since 1990</li>
    <li><strong>Pop2000</strong> = the state resident population on 1 April 2000</li>
</ul>
