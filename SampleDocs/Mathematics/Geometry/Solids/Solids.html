<p>Introduction</p>
<body>
<p>The Johnson solids are all  the convex polyhedra having regular faces and equal edge lengths. (Convex means having no indentations.) They do not include the completely regular Platonic solids, the "semiregular" Archimedean solids, and the two infinite families of prisms and antiprisms. There are exactly 92 of them.
