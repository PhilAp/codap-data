<p>The following problem is loosely based on Showcase Showdown from "The Price is Right." The game is played on "the Big
    Wheel", which is a fair spinner filled with integers 1 through 20. The goal is to get as close to 20
    without going over.</p>

<p> Each player will take up to two spins of the wheel. After the first spin, the players can choose to either stay with
    the integer they landed on or spin again; on the second spin, whatever the contestant gets will be added to the
    first score. As mentioned, if a player goes over 20, that contestant is eliminated from the game; otherwise the player
    stands under the scoreboard and waits it out. In the event of a tie, the first player wins.</p>

<p>In this simplified form of the Showcase Showdown, there is only one real choice to be made by the players: After
    the first spin, the first player has to decide whether to spin again. Whatever the resulting score, the second
    player has an obvious strategy: if the first spin would result in a loss, then spin again no matter what the
    score.</p>

<p><b>The Problem:</b></p>
<p>Find the largest result of the first spin for which the first player should spin the wheel a second
    time. (Equivalently, find the smallest value for which the first player should "stand" and not spin a second time.)
    We'll say that a strategy "should" be followed if the probability of winning with the strategy exceeds that of
    winning with the complementary strategy.</p>
<p>Assuming that the first player uses the optimal strategy, is the game fair? More precisely, what is the probability
    that the first player will win with this strategy?</p>
