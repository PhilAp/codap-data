<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<body>
<p>Start with a random number between 0 and 1. Take that number and multiply it by 1 minus itself times a certain fixed number called a seed.</p>
<p>So, you have:  <em>x</em>[n] = <em>x</em>[<em>n</em>-1](1 - <em>x</em>[<em>n</em>-1])&middot;<em>seed</em></p>
<p>Repeat this process 30 times and record the last value.</p>
<!--<p>Experiment with different values for seed. Each time you change seed, the seed itself will be recorded as R, as well as the last value, now called endval.</p>-->
<p>Chaos has the characteristic that small changes in the input produce disproportionately large changes in the output. (The butterfly's wingbeat alters the course of a hurricane.)</p>
<p>For what range of values for seed is the behavior of growth chaotic?</p>

<p>What part does the number of iterations (30) play in determining the chaos?</p>
