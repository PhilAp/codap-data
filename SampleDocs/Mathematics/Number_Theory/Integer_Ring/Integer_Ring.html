<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>In a ring of integers mod <i>n</i>, 0 through <i>n</i>â€“1 are the only integers. Ordinary addition and multiplication is done modulo the integer <I>n</I>. </p>
<p>So, for example, in the ring of integers mod 5, 4+3 = 2 because you take the usual result, 7, and get the remainder after dividing by 5. Similarly, in the ring of integers mod 5, 2 * 3 is 1.</p>
<p>The two summary tables below provide the addition table (on the left) and multiplication table (on the right). Ignore the row and column summaries, since they are not helpful here.</p>
<p>The graphs show the tables using colors to differentiate the results for mod 19.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Try clicking on one of the cells of a summary table.
    <li>Also try clicking on a portion of the color legend to highlight all the cells that have that value.
</ul>
