    <li>What interest rate will double the initial investment in 3 years?</li>
    <li>For a given initial investment and interest rate, how much more is the principal at the end of three years compounding monthly versus compounding once a year?</li>
    <li>Suppose you are saving for a motorbike that costs $3500. Your aunt gives you $500 to start with and you find a fabulous savings account that earns 9% compounded monthly. How much will you need to add to the account each month to reach your goal by the end of two years? How much more would you need to add each month if your aunt had not started you off with $500?.</li>
