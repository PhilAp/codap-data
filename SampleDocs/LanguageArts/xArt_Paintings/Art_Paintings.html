<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Some questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Of all the different art styles represented by the paintings in the National Gallery of Art, which style has the greatest number of paintings? How does that number correspond to the length of the artistic period in history? Some art movements occupy many years in the historical timeline, some only a few. Investigate the long ones and the short ones, and discuss some reasons for these differences.</li>
    <li>Find a style of painting that sounds interesting, and look up the painting on the NGA website, if an image is available. Do you like this style? Why or why not? How does the painting affect you? What emotion do you feel when viewing the painting? What emotion do you think the artist was trying to show?  Find another painting from the same artist or in the same art style. How are the two paintings similar? How are they different? Is it that you dislike all paintings in this style, or only this particular painting?</li>
    <li>On the NGA website, if you search by "subject" for "still life", find one by artist Mark Rothko (1986.56.663), then look at another still life painting by Willem Heda (1991.87.1). Why do you think they are in the same category if they are so different from each other? <br>Now search the NGA website, and find two (image-available) paintings of the same subject, yet that are also different styles. For the two paintings that you chose, what about your two makes them similar? What makes them different? </li>
    <li>Which artist has more paintings than any other in the National Gallery of Art? Which artist has the second-most? What country are they from? From these data, which country is represented more than any other, based on the artists' nationality? Why are artists from that country represented more than any other in the National Gallery of Art?</li>
    <li>Pretend that you are a rich art collector. What types of paintings would you acquire? Would you seek ones in a certain medium, by a favorite artist, of a particular style or theme, or artist nationality? Why?</li>
