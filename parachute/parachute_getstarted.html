<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>This is a model of a ball drop that allows you to experiment with different object masses and different parachute sizes to see their effect on an object's terminal velocity.</p>
<p><b>To start experimenting:</b>
<ol>
    <li>Click on the Start button to start the simulation. The simulation will stop automatically when terminal velocity has been achieved.</li>
    <li>Click on the Analyze button to see the data in a CODAP table.</li>
    <li>To restart the simulation, click on the New Run button.</li>
    <li>To change the mass of the object, click and drag on the slider under Mass of jumper.</li>
    <li>To change the size of the parachute, click and drag on the slider under Parachute size.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>To a see a visualization of your data, click on the Graph icon <img class="icon" src="resources/images/graph_icon.png"></p>
<p><b>The Case Table</b>
<ul>
    <li>Take a look at how the table is organized, including the column headings on the left and right sides of the table.</li>
    <li>Click on the "-" or "+" symbols in the middle. What happens?</li>
    <li>Hover over the column headings. What happens?</li>
    <li>Click on a line on the left side table. What happens? What happens in the graph?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><b>The Graph</b>
<ul>
    <li>Take a look at the graph. What do the data points represent?</li>
    <li>Click and drag "Time" column header from the table to the x-axis on the graph.</li>
    <li>Click and drag "Distance" column header from the table to the y-axis on the graph.</li>
    <li>Hover over a point on the graph. What happens?</li>
    <li>Click on a point on the graph. What happens? What happens in the table?</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>What is the effect of the mass and the parachute size on terminal velocity?</p>
