Some columns are fixed because the values come from the model or sensor. You cannot change fixed columns.</p>

<p>Other columns can accept measurements (or formulas). Sometimes they are already made for you,
or you can add your own. In the example below, a student has added "distance" and "height" 
and then entered values by hand.

<p>Note that there are two “levels” in the table: <b>time series of run </b> (on the right),
and the <b>summary of run</b> for different runs (on the left).</p>
