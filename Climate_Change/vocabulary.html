<body><h2>New Vocabulary</h2>

<p>A <b>variable</b> is a general name for a values that changes. An <b>independent variable </b>
is one that an experimenter can control.  For example, the CO2 levels in this simulation is an independent variable.</p>

<p>A <b>dependent variable</b> is an outcome of the experiment such as the final temperature of the atmosphere at the end of the simulation.</p>
<p>Independent variables can also be called <b>parameters</b> or <b>attributes</b>. Each 
column in the data table below shows the values for variables such as time, distance, 
mass, or period.  Columns can contain attributes that are set by the model or by your experiment, or that are the result of a measurement 
or calculation.</p>
<p>Each row in the table shows a <b>run</b>, which is the result of one experiment. 
Most runs consist of many samples collected over time. This is called a <b>time-series</b>. 
For instance, you may have recorded the position of a car during a run.   
Each row also has the <b>summary</b> values for the run, such as run number, mass, or period.</p>

<p>Note that there are two “levels” in the table: <b>time series</b> of a single run (on the right),
and the <b>summary attributes</b> of different runs (on the left).</p>
