<ul>
    <li><strong>Phase</strong>: A stage within the Cup. In the first phase all participating countries play; in the second phase about half the countries are gone; in the quarterfinals there are eight countries left, and four in the semifinals. The Bronze match decides the third and fourth places, and the Final decides the first and second.</li>
    <li><strong>AET</strong> = After extra time: Some games can't end in a draw, so if the scores are tied after the standard play time, extra times (up to two 15-min sessions) are played to untie. This attribute shows the final score in those cases.</li>
    <li><strong>APK</strong> After penalty kicks: If the tie remains after the extra times, the game is decided by the teams alternately kicking penalties. This attribute shows the final score in those cases.</li>
</ul>
