<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Here are 2000 words randomly chosen from the YAWL (yet another word list) that comes with the Unix operating system. In that list there are 263,743 words.</p>

<p>Some questions:</p>

<ol>
    <li>What proportion of these 2000 words do you "know" the meaning of? So, approximately how many words in the original list should you know?</li>
    <li>What is the distribution of word lengths?</li>
</ol>
