<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A <strong>Googlewhack</strong> is a two-word query of the Google search engine that produces a single result. (Actually the rules a just a bit more complicated than that).</p>

<p>The collection at left contains the most recent 500 of the more than 450,000 Googlewhacks that were listed on November 11, 2004. (Of course they might not be valid any more!)</p>
