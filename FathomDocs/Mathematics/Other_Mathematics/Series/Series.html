<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>The five points in the collection correspond to the running sum of the first five terms in a Fourier series.</p>
<p>To do</p>
<ul>
    <li>Animate the slider, t. Notice the way the points in the line scatter plot swing around as though they are on a multi-jointed mechanical arm. The x and y coordinates of the end point of the arm vary with t just as does the blue function plotted in the graph at right.</li>
    <li>Each of the five sliders controls the amplitude of a term in the Fourier series. Describe the effect of each of the amplitudes on both the arm and on the red function plot at right.</li>
    <li>By changing the values of the five sliders, you can form the blue function into many different shapes. See how close you can get to a "square wave," a "sawtooth wave," and a "triangle wave."</li>
</ul>
