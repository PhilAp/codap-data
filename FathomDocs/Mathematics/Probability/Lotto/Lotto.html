<h5><strong>Does Lotto pay?</strong></h5>

<p>The "Numbers" collection at left contains the numbers 1 through 80, from which we sample 8 at a time without replacement into the "Sample of Numbers" collection.</p>

<p>Measures in the sample collection compute the number of matches and the Payoff. You can find the winning numbers in the formula for isMatch in the Numbers collection. The payoffs for each possible number of matches are set by the slider values at right. The sliders below report the current number of matches and the payoff.</p>

<p>So, granted that you won't win big very often, still, it might be that when you do win big, it more than pays for all the times you lost.</p>

<p>So find out. Use Fathom's ability to collect measures to keep track of a bunch of rounds (A big bunch!)</p>

<p>By the way, it costs 1 "unit" to play a round.</p>
