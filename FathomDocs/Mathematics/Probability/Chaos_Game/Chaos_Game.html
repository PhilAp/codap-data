<h3>Introduction</h3>

<h5><strong>Chaos Game Simulation</strong></h5>

<p>Choose three points in he nit square to be vertices of a triangle.</p>

<p>Start by choosing a point at random in the unit square. For each subsequent "move" one vertex of a triangle is chosen at random and the new point is chosen to be 1/2 the distance from the current point to that vertex.</p>

<p>Animate the t slider to observe the evolution of the game in the graph of x and y.</p>

<p>There are parameters to vary: number of verticies, and ratio of distance being the most obvious. Explore!</p>

<p>There are many online discussions of The Chaos Game. See for example:
