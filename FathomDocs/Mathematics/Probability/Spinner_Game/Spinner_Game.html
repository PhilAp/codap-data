<p>The following problem is loosely based on Showcase Showdown from "The Price is Right." The game is played on a fair
    spinner dubbed "the Big Wheel", which is filled with integers 1 through 20. The goal is to get as close to 20
    without going over. Each spin value has the same probability: <i>p</i> = 1/20. Each player gets to spin either once
    or twice and ends up with a score â€” the sum of integers from his/her spin(s).</p>

<p> Each player will take up to two spins of the wheel. After the first spin, the spinner can choose to either stay with
    the integer he/she landed on or spin again; on the second spin, whatever the contestant gets will be added to the first
    score. As mentioned, if he/she goes over 20, that contestant is eliminated from the game; otherwise the player
    stands under the scoreboard and waits it out. In the event of a tie, the first player wins.</p>

<p>In the our simplified form of the Showcase Showdown, there is only one real choice to be made by the players: After
    the first spin, the first player has to decide whether to spin again. Whatever the resulting score, the second
    player has an obvious strategy: if the first spin would result in a loss, then spin again no matter what the score.</p>

<h1>The Problem:</h1>
<p>Find the largest result of the first spin for which the first player should spin the wheel a second
    time. (Equivalently, find the smallest value for which the first player should "stand" and not spin a second time.)
    We'll say that a strategy "should" be followed if the probability of winning with the strategy exceeds that of
    winning with the complementary strategy. Assuming that the first player uses the optimal strategy, is the game fair?
    More precisely, what is the probability that the first player will win with this strategy?</p>
