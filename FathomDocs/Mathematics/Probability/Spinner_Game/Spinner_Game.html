<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>The following problem is loosely based on Showcase Showdown from "The Price is Right." Two contestants play a game using a fair spinner that generates an integer n, 1  n  20, with each value of n having the same probability: p = 1/20. Each player gets to spin either once or twice and ends up with a score -- the sum of the n's from his spin(s). The first player completes his turn before the second player begins. A score greater than 20 automatically loses but otherwise the larger score wins. In the event of a tie, the first player wins.</p>

<p>In the above simplified form of the Showcase Showdown, there is only one real choice to be made by the players: After the first spin, player one has to decide whether to spin again. Whatever his resulting score, player two has an obvious strategy √ê if his first spin would result in a loss, he should spin again no matter what his score.</p>

<p>The Problem: Find the largest result of the first spin for which the first player should spin the wheel a second time. (Equivalently, find the smallest value for which the first player should "stand" and not spin a second time.) We'll say that a strategy "should" be followed if the probability of winning with the strategy exceeds that of winning with the complementary strategy.  Assuming that the first player uses the optimal strategy, is the game fair? More precisely, what is the probability that the first player will win with this strategy?</p>

<p>The Games collection contains 1000 games. If player 1 gets a number larger than the slider Largest on the first spin, it stops. Otherwise it spins again. The bar chart shows the number each player won out of the 1000 games.</p>
