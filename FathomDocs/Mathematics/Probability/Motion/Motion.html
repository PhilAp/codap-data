<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>A molecule starts at position (0, 0). In each time frame, its x-coordinate can change by a number between -1 and 1 and the same for the y-coordinate. The graph shows its motion and the summary table computes its final distance from the origin.</p>

<h5>To Do:</h5>
<ul>
    <li> Find the expected final distance by collecting measures from the molecule collection.</li>
    <li> Have the molecule jump by integer amounts instead of real amounts.</li>
    <li> Try different numbers of steps, especially a very <em>small</em> number.</li>
    <li> Use a slider to simulate a "drift."</li>
    <li> Choose a random angle and radius for each step.</li>
</ul>
