<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>Three people--A, B, and C--engage in a water gun duel. Each person takes turns making a shot at one of the other people. A has a probability of 1/3 of hitting; B has a probability of 2/3 of hitting; and C always hits. A starts, then B, then C, and they repeat until only one person is dry.</p>

<p>Here we simulate this with two different strategies. In both strategies, B and C always shoot at the person left dry who has the highest probability of hitting.</p>

<p>In strategy 1, A uses the same strategy as the other two. In strategy 2, A passes on the first round.</p>

<p><strong>Which strategy is the best for A?</strong> You can decide by collecting measures from each of the simulations.</p>
