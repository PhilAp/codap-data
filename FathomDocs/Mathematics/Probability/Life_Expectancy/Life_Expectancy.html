<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>What's the chance that you're going to die in the next year? </p>
<p>Using the table, assume that "Life Expectancy" is the expected value of the time to your death. Also assume that the table does not change from year to year.</p>
<p>Ultimately, make -- and explain -- a graph of death probability as a function of age.</p>
