<p>The problem, posted by Pat Ballew, is:</p>
<P><i>A randomly shuffled standard deck of 52 cards is dealt into 26 pairs. How many of the pairs make a "21" hand?</i>
<p>Restated, find the average number of pairs of cards that would add to 21 with 10's and face cards counting ten points
    and aces counting eleven.</p>

<p>This sample collection has a predefined measure that counts how many blackjack pairs there are. By collecting these
    measures, you can answer Pat's question.</p>
