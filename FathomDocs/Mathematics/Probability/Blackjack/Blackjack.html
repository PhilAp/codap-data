<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The problem, as posted by Pat Ballew on the Fathom list serve, is:
    <br>A randomly shufffled deck of 52 cards is dealt into 26 pairs. How many of the pairs make a "21" hand? Restated, what is the average number of these pairs that would add to 21 with 10's and face cards counting ten points and aces counting eleven.</p>

<p>The sample collection has a predefined measure that counts how many blackjack pairs there are. By collecting these measures, you can answer Pat's question.</p>
