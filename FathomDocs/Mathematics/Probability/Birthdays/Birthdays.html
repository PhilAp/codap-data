<p><strong>Is any one day of the year more likely to be born on than any other?</strong></p>
<p>This data gives the distribution of birthdays for births in the U.S. in 1978. It was used by Professor Geoffrey
    Berresford in his article: "The uniformity assumption in the birthday problem, Math. Mag. 53 1980, no. 5, 286-288."
    If you plot a times series of the data you will have a nice example of periodic data.</p>
