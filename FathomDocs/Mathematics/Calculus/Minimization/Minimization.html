<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>The problem here is to find the minimum of the function plotted at top right. This won't be trivial by taking the derivative, setting it equal to zero, and solving for x.</p>
<p>So, instead, we make the collection of points shown above and compute both f and the change in f for each value of x. By plotting x versus df, we can see the x for which df is 0, to arbitrary precision by zooming in on the graph and by adjusting dx.</p>
