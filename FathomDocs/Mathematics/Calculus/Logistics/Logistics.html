<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>Consider the logistic function f(x) = kx(1 - x). Choose some start value for x (the "seed"). Now plot and connect with a line the successive points (x, f(x)), (f(x), f(f(x))), (f(f(x)), f(f(f(x)))), ...). The plot below shows the result along with the logistic function and the line y = x. It's called a "web diagram" because it can easily turn into something that resembles a spider web.</p>
<p>Investigate the effect of changing <strong>seed</strong> and <strong>k</strong>. Find values of <strong>k</strong> for which the behavior is periodic, and others for which it is "chaotic."</p>

<h4>To Do:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Investigate the effect of changing seed and k. Find values of k for which the behavior is periodic, and others for which it is "chaotic."</li>
    <li>Construct web diagrams for other functions such as a quadratic.</li>
</ol>
