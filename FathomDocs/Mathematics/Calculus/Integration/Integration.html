<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>This document illustrates how to do numerical integration of an arbitrary function. The sliders control the bounds, the granularity, and the constant of integration.</p>
<p>The graphs to the left show the function and its integral as a function of <strong>x</strong>.</p>
<p>The integral of <strong>f(x)</strong> from <strong>x_lower</strong> to <strong>x_upper</strong> is given in the summary table above.</p>
<p>It is the last value of the attribute <strong>cum</strong>.</p>
<h4>Questions</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Describe what happens when <strong>x_lower</strong> and <strong>x_upper</strong> are dragged. Explain the effect on the value for the integral.</li>
    <li>Describe what happens when <strong>const_of_integration</strong> is dragged.</li>
    <li>What is the correspondence between the data points at the top of the <strong>cumulative</strong> curve and the points on the <strong>f_x plot</strong>?</li>
</ol>

<h4>To Do</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Choose a different function to integrate.</li>
    <li>Do an integration both symbolically and numerically and study the "error;" that is, the difference between the two values.</li>
</ul>
