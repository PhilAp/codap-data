<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>Knowing how much something was worth in a base year, we can estimate how much it was worth in some other year by looking up the consumer price index for the two years and multiplying the ratio times the base year price.</p>
<h4>How to use it:</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Think of something you know the price for in some year; e.g. you might know the comic book in 1956 was 10 cents.</li>
    <li>Enter the <strong>Base Year</strong> and the <strong>AmtInBaseYear</strong>.</li>
    <li>Enter the yearfor which you would like an estimated price based on the CPI alone in <strong>CalcYear</strong>.</li>
    <li>The estimated price is calculated in <strong>AmtInCalcYear</strong>.</li>
</ol>
