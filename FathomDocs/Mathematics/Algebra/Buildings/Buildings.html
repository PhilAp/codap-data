<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h5>A Question</h5>
<p>How is the height of a building related to the number of stories it has?</p>

<h5>Prediction</h5>
<p>The relevant attributes are height and stories. How do you predict the two quantities will be related? In particular, about how many feet do you think there are per story?</p>

<h5>Measurement</h5>
<p>Analyze the data. Be sure to use a movable line. Describe briefly what you did.</p>

<h5>Comparison</h5>
<p>Compare your prediction to the data. Report what you found out. Refine your description of the relationship between height and number of stories. Develop a rule of thumb (a simple calculation) you can use to predict the height of a building from the number of stories. Describe that rule.</p>
