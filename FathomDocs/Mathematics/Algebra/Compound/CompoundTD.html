<h2>To Do</h2>
<body>

<ol>
    <li>Investigate the relationship between payments per period and the amount of principal after three years. Be as quantitative as possible.</li>
    <li>Figure out how to use this model to show paying back a loan. If you borrow $1200 at 4.5% yearly interest and have 3 years to pay it back, how much will you have to pay each month?</li>
    <li>Extend the model to accommodate changes in interest rates and varying payments.</li>
    <li>Investigate the effect of a negative interest rate. What are some real-life situations that correspond to this?</li>
</ol>
