<h2>Introduction</h2>
<body>
<p>This case table shows a model of a savings account.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Initial investment is the amount of money that is deposited in the account at the beginning.</li>
    <li>Interest rate is the yearly interest in percent.</li>
    <li>PeriodsPerYear defines the interval at which compounding of interest takes place.</li>
    <li>PaymentPerPeriod defines the amount that is deposited into the account in each period.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Questions</h5>
<ol>
    <li>If the initial investment is $100, how much will be in the account after 2 years if the interest rate is 6%?</li>
    <li>What interest rate will double the initial investment in 3 years?</li>
    <li>For a given initial investment and interest rate, how much more is the principal at the end of three years compounding monthly versus compounding once a year?</li>
    <li>Suppose you are saving for a motorbike that costs $3500. Your aunt gives you $500 to start with and you find a fabulous savings account that earns 9% compounded monthly.How much will you need to add to the account each month to reach your goal by the end of two years? How much more would you need to add each month if your aunt had not started you off with $500?.</li>
</ol>

<h5>To Do</h5>
<ol>
    <li>Investigate the relationship between payments per period and the amount of principal after three years. Be as quantitative as possible.</li>
    <li>Figure out how to use this model to show paying back a loan. If you borrow $1200 at 4.5% yearly interest and have 3 years to pay it back, how much will you have to pay each month?</li>
    <li>Extend the model to accommodate changes in interest rates and varying payments.</li>
    <li>Investigate the effect of a negative interest rate. What are some real-life situations that correspond to this?</li>
</ol>
