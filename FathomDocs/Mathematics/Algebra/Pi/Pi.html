<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>There is no automatic way to get a scale marked in units of pi. However, you can accomplish it as shown here. In the units row of the case table (Table->Show Units) enter "pi." You'll be told that this is not a known unit and asked if you want to define it. Click <em>Yes</em>.</p>

<p>Now, when this attribute is used on a graph axis, the unit will be "pi" as shown in the scatter plot.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to use trig functions with these values, you'll have to multiply them by pi.</p>
