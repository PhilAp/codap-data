<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>Here is a problem from an eighth grade algebra book, meant to be solved using the "guess and check" method.</p>
<p>Melissa's free throw average is 0.875. If she were to be given 20 more free throws and get 13 of them in the basket, her new free throw rate would be 0.860. How many free throw opportunities has she had thus far?</p>
