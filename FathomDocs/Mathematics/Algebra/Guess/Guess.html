<p>Here is a problem from an eighth grade algebra book, meant to be solved using the "guess and check" method:</p>
<p><i>Melissa's free throw average is 0.875. If she were to be given 20 more free throws and get 13 of them in the
    basket, her new free throw rate would be 0.860. How many free throw opportunities has she had thus far?</i></p>

<h3>Guessing and Checking</h3>
<p>The first attribute, FreeThrows, can be edited in order to make guesses. The rightmost attribute, NewAverage, gives
    Melissa's new free throw average. </p>

<p>Study the formulas for each attribute. You can see and open the Formula Editor by clicking on the attribute and
    selecting "Edit Formula." This opens up the Formula Editor.</p>

<P>In NumGottenSoFar, the number of free throws is 0.875 times FreeThrows. This is the number of freethrows Melissa got
    so far.
</P>
<p>The problem says that Melissa would have been given 20 more freethrows. This is NewFreeThrows, which has the
    equation NumGottenSoFar+20. The shots that Melissa gets is NewFreeThrows+13, which is NewNumGotten. Melissa's new
    average is NewNumGotten/NewFreeThrows. Study the formulas to see how guess and check works in CODAP.</p>

<h3>Movable Line</h3>
<p>The movable line helps us see where the FreeThrows are and to identify a point that lies at NewAverage = 0.86. You
    can slide the line up and down to see different
    values at horizontal points. You can also hover over the points to see the value of New Averages for each FreeThrow.
