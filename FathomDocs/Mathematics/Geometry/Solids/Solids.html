<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>The Johnson solids are all  the convex polyhedra having regular faces and equal edge lengths. (Convex means having no indentations.) They do not include the completely regular Platonic solids, the "semiregular" Archimedean solids, and the two infinite families of prisms and antiprisms. There are exactly 92 of them.

<p>For images and nets of the solids see: <a href = "http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JohnsonSolid.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/JohnsonSolid.html</a></p>

<h5>Questions</h5>
<ol>
    <li>How are the numbers of polygons related to the numbers of faces, edges, or vertices?</li>
    <li>Find the surface areas of the polyhedra. How are the surface areas related to the number of faces, edges, or vertices?</li>
    <li>What do the different parts of the names mean? Try filtering for different prefixes and suffixes and looking for patterns.</li>
    <li>Add data for the Platonic and Archimedean solids. Do they conform to the patterns you found for the Johnson solids?</li>
</ol>
