<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>In a ring of integers mod n, 0 through n-1 are the only integers there are, and ordinary addition and multiplication is done modulo the integer n. So, for example, in the ring of integers mod 5, 4+3 = 2 because you take the usual result, 7, and get the remainder after dividing by 5. Similarly, in the ring of integers mod 5, 2 * 3 is 1.</p>
<p>The two summary tables below provide the addition table (on the left) and multiplication table (on the right). Ignore the row and column summaries, as they are not helpful here.</p>
<p>The graphs show the tables using colors to differentiate the results.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Try clicking on one of the cells of a summary table or on one of the colored squares in the graph.
    <li>Also try clicking on a portion of the color legend to highlight all the cells that have that value.
    <li>Explore different values of n. You can go all the way up to 24.
    <li>What patterns do you see the colors of the two graphs as n changes?
</ul>
