<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>You probably know that there are an infinite number of primes, and you may even know a proof of this fact. But how does the <em>spacing</em> of primes change as you go further and further along the number line?</p>
<p>This document is set up to help you investigate this question. The <strong>Numbers</strong> collection contains the integers from start to stop. Each integer is marked as either prime or not prime.</p>
<p>There are two <em>measures</em>: <strong>numPrime</strong> counts the number of prime numbers and <strong>start</strong> just records the starting place.</p>
