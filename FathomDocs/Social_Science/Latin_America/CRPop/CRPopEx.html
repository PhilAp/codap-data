<p>This case table provides information about the population of Costa Rica since 1522.</p>

<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find in the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what year the population of Costa Rica was 15,538</li>
    <li>Click on one of the dots in the graph. What happens in the table?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. What information is displayed in the box that appears?<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Think about it:</strong></h5>
<ul>
    <li>What statements can you make based on the data shown? Is there a trend? Are there any relationships?</li>
    <li>Find an equation that predicts the population as a function of the year. (Hint: Notice that there was a minimum around 1600. A straight exponential regression won't work. Try an equation of the form y = exp(ax^2+bx+c)).</li>
</ul>
