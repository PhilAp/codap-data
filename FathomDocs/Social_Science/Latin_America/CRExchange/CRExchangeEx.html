<h2>Explore!</h2>
<body>

<p>This case table contains information about the exchange rates for the Costa rican Col√≥n with respect to US Dollar. ExchangeRate is the average between the buying and selling rates on (a) the 15th day of the month up to Dec 2002, or (b) the last day of the month from Jan 2003.</p>

<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find in the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what month of the year 1987 the exchange rate was 61.3?</li>
    <li>Click on one of the dots in the graph. What happens in the table?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. What information is displayed in the box that appears?<br/><br/></li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Think about it:</strong></h5>
<ul>
    <li>What statements can you make based on the data shown? Is there a trend? Are there any relationships?</li>
    <li>Find an equation that estimates the exchange rate as a function of year and month. (Hint: define an attribute, like Year_decimal, in such a way that January 1986 is represented as 1986.0 and July 1986 is 1986.5, for example. Then plot Year_decimal vs Exchange_rate and notice that the equation must be defined piecewise.)
        <li>Does the percent rate of increase (of the exchange rate) vary with a predictable pattern? (Hint: Define the percent rate of increase as 100*Exchange_rate/(Exchange_rate a year ago). Figure out a way to compute the Exchange_rate a year ago.)</li>
</ul>
