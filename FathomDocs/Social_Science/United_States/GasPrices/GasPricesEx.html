<p>A history of gasoline prices in parts of Texas for the past 27 years based on what I paid at the pump. Most recent tank: March 26, 2007.</p>

<h5>Gasoline Price History</h5>
<p>The following plot shows how much I paid for each gallon of gas I bought over the past 27 years or so. The data has a somewhat varied pedigree. Most of the purchases from 1979-1982 were in the Rio Vista/Fort Worth, Texas area. From late 1982-1983 was from College Station/Rio Vista about equally. From 1984-1987 was a Rio Vista/College Station/Houston mix and from 1987 on has been mostly Houston with a little Fort Worth thrown in. Just about everything pre-1984 was full service and everything since has been self-serve. Every tank shown was "super" unleaded (92-93 octane).

    CPG is the actual price paid for each gallon. CPG_adj adjusted for inflation using April, 1979 as the datum. That is, the data have been adjusted to "April 1979 dollars". The "CPI-All Urban Consumers for all items less energy" was used to adjust the data using monthly average data interoplated to the actual purchase dates.</p>
