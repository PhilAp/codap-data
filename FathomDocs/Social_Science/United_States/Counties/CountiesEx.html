<p>The National Post (<a id="outside_link1" href="http://www.nationalpost.com/" target="_blank_parent">www.nationalpost.com</a>) published a map on January 13, 2005 of the 2004 US Presidential election data coloured by county which made it look like the vast majority of votes were cast for the Republicans, when in fact the election was quite close.</p>

<p>This case table shows data from the over 3000 counties in the continental US, each with its latitude and longitude, is wonderful for exploring geographic distributions. Each point in the graph at right corresponds to one county. Some of the attributes are explained on the next page.</p>

<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find in the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out which state the county of Daniels is in?</li>
    <li>Click on one of the dots in the graph. What happens in the table?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. What information is displayed in the box that appears?<br/><br/></li>
    <li><strong>Think about it:</strong>&nbsp What statements can you make based on the data shown? Is there a trend? Are there any relationships?</li>
</ul>
