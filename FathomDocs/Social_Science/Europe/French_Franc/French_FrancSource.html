<p>The data used in this activity was obtained from the National Institiute of Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) of France. You can find more information about it <a id="outside_link1" href="http://www.insee.fr/en/default.asp" target="_blank_parent">here</a>.</p>

<p>Some information from the site:</p>

<p>Users of these data should note that data robustness decreases as the time periods stretch into the past and that these data cannot be used as legally binding  references. The euro and French franc purchasing power indicator is suitable for measuring monetary erosion related to household consumption. However, it is not suitable for measuring the monetary erosion of assets made up of real estate and financial instruments not included in the general price index.</p>
