    <li>As of 1992, data on Municipal By-Law incidents are not available. When comparing previous years to 1992 or later, Municipal By-Law data must be excluded. As of 1995, data on Provincial Statutes are not available. When comparing previous years to 1995, Provincial Statutes data must be excluded. As of 1997, counts for all respondents include Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) cases occurring within the respondent's jurisdiction. Prior to 1997, Woodstock, Vancouver and ten other municipal police forces in British Columbia were the only respondents reporting data that included RCMP counts.</li>
    <li>In 1992, Metropolitan Toronto Police converted to the revised Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey. The Metropolitan Toronto Police has historically reported their crime data to UCR Survey according to a multiple offence scoring rule. Therefore, caution should be used when comparing current data to 1991 or earlier years for Toronto, Ontario and Canada. Adolescents and children who are not charged are not counted in the person counts entitled informal or not charged in Toronto data.</li>
    <li>Between 1977 and 1984, an offence code was assigned to Juvenile Delinquents Act. The offence code was not used from 1985 to 1998. In 1999, the Firearms Act has been re-assigned the same offence code. Comparisons over time for this offence code should not be made.</li>
    <li>Prior to 1999, a number of Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachments in Saskatchewan were double counting the number of actual offences of impaired driving. This over-counting was corrected in 1999, therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution. It is recommended that the analysis of impaired driving be based on persons charged data rather than actual offences.</li>
    <li>The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) repealed and replaced the Narcotic Control Act (NCA) and parts of the Food and Drugs Act (FDA) in 1996. With this change in legislation, offences related to the possession, trafficking and importation of certain controlled or restricted drugs not identified in the earlier statutes are now (since 1997) included in other drugs category. Hence, comparisons with years prior to 1997 should be made with caution.</li>
    <li>Rates are based on population estimates of police jurisdictions derived from the July 1, 2001 estimates provided by the Demography Division of Statistics Canada. The estimates are adjusted for net census undercount.</li>
    <li>Homicide data are extracted from the Homicide Survey database.</li>
    <li>Data for 2001 include estimates for 3 months for Vancouver Police and 2 months for Port Moody Police, covering the phase-in period required for a new records management system. In addition, from September 2000 to September 2001, as a result of labour action, there were decreases in the number of crimes reported to the Vancouver Police Department for certain offences. As a result, the number of Criminal Code offences reported by Vancouver were affected during this period.</li>
    <li>OPP data for 2001 were not available due to implementation of a new records management system. As such, 2000 OPP data have been substituted.</li>
    <li>The increase in "disturbing the peace" may be, in part, attributable to a national data quality initiative undertaken by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) to properly account for the types of offences that are aggregated under this offence.</li>
    <li>During the revision of the 2001 data for the province of Ontario, a discrepancy in methodology applied by the forces in the province using the Ontario Municipal and Provincial Police Automated Co-operative (OMPPAC) system was detected. These forces report approximately one-third of the total criminal incidents for the province and include the OPP and 40 small and mid-sized municipal forces. This discrepancy resulted in an over-count of less serious criminal incidents in cases where more than one offence type was associated within the same incident. The net effect was an over-count of the total number of criminal incidents in Ontario for 2001. The data revision disproportionately affects incident counts for less serious offences that most frequently occur in combination with other offence types. For example, counts for the "possession of stolen property", which often occur during the same incident as the more serious offence of "break and enter", have been revised downward by 13% for Ontario for 2001, while counts for "break and enter" have been revised downward by 3%. Comparisons of the revised Ontario data for 2001 and the 2002 data to earlier years should be made with caution as further analysis of the impact on the Ontario time series prior to 2001 has not yet been completed. This analysis may result in a revision to the historical time series to improve the comparability of the historical information.</li>
    <li>Homicide investigations undertaken by the Missing Women's Task Force in Port Coquitlam resulted in 15 homicides being reported by police in 2002. Homicide counts reflect the year in which police file the report.</li>
    <li>Revisions have been made to the number of "actual" impaired driving incidents for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in 2000 and 2001. These revisions resulted in a 6% reduction in actual incidents at the Canada level for 2000 and 9% for 2001. These changes did not affect the national impaired driving trend. The number of persons "charged" with impaired driving offences did not require revision.</li>
