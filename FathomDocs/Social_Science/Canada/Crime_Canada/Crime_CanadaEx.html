<p>This case table contains information about crime in Canada. Numbers are actual and rates are per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>In 1983, changes to the Criminal Code affected the classification of assaults, sexual assaults and abduction. New offence codes were introduced in 1983 to replace the old codes due to changes in the definition of the offences. Hence, data for these offences are not available prior to 1983.</p>

<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
