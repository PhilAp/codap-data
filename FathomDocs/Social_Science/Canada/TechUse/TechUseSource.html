<p>From the website, some information about The General Social Servey (GSS):<br/><br/>
    The General Social Survey (GSS) program, originating in 1985, conducts
    telephone surveys. Each survey contains a core topic, focus or exploratory
    questions and a standard set of socio-demographic questions used for
    classification. More recent cycles have also included some qualitative
    questions, which explore opinions and perceptions. The two primary
    objectives of the GSS are: to gather data on social trends in order to
    monitor temporal changes in the living conditions and well being of
    Canadians; and to provide immediate information on specific social policy
    issues of current or emerging interest. The GSS collects data from the total
    population 15 years of age and older, living in private households. It
    covers 10 provinces and excludes Yukon, Northwest Territories and Nunavut.<br/><br/>

    Cycle 14 is the first cycle of the General Social Survey to collect detailed
    information on access to and use of information communication technology in
    Canada. Topics include general use of technology and computers, technology
    in the workplace, development of computer skills, frequency of Internet and
    E-mail use, non-users and security and information on the Internet. The
    target population of the GSS is all individuals aged 15 and over living in a
    private household in one of the ten provinces.</p>
