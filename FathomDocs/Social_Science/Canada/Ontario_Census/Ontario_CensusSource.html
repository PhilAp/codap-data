    <li>This information was extracted from the 2001 Census CANSIM on Statistics Canada's archived website, in the <a href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/english/census01/products/standard/popdwell/Table-CSD.cfm" target="_parent_blank">Census Subdivision</a> section of the Population and Dwelling Counts, in 2004, accessed on September 2, 2015. CANSIM is a multidimensional database containing time series data from over 250 different surveys,and is free to educational institutions and depository libraries. Visit <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/start-debut-eng.html" target="_parent_blank">their website</a> for further information on the supports provided.<br/><br/></li>

    <li>The extraction, editing and preparation of this dataset were by Ross Isenegger, Near North District School Board,  and Joel Yan, Statistics Canada. We wanted to make it easy for users to filter the 488 municipalities into smaller subsets based on region of Ontario. We used database software to add the County/District and Economic Region names. There are 11 economic regions in Ontario. The boundaries of these areas are determined based on labour market areas and analysis. The official economic region names and codes are used. For further details on this see <a href="http://www.statcan.ca/english/Subjects/Standard/sgc/2001/2001-sgc-index.htm" target="_parent_blank">here</a> and for a reference map of these areas visit <a href="http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Maps/ReferenceMaps/n_er_e.cfm" target="_parent_blank">geodepot.statcan.ca</a>.<br/><br/></li>

    <li><p>We also added in Latitude-Longitude and Lambert Conformal Conic coordinates as attributes "x" and "y" for a "representative point" within each CSD/ Municipality in this collection. A representative point is a single point located centrally within the area feature. This point is a good location in relation to the area boundary for displaying text or a symbol. The Lambert Conformal Conic provides good directional and shape relationships for mid-latitude regions having a mainly east-to-west extent.  Standard parallels at 49 degrees North and 77 degrees North are most commonly used.  Scale is correct along the standard parallels only.</p>

        <p>These coordinates were extracted on November 12, 2004 from the Statistics Canada product called GeoSuite (2001 Census). GeoSuite is a tool for data retrieval, query, and tabular output, with software and data on a CD-ROM. GeoSuite allows users to explore the links between all standard levels of geography and to determine geographic codes, names, and population and dwelling counts.
