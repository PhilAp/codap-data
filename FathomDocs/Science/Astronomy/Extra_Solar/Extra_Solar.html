</head>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<body>
<p>This data set has information on the 111 masses and orbital characteristics of known extrasolar planets. Check out the table and the graphs to see what you can learn about them!</p>

<h5><strong>Examine the tables and graphs:</strong></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the mass of <strong>51peg</strong>?</li>
    <li>Look at the graph below and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the other graphs? Can you tell from a graph how the mass of am extrasolar planet affects its orbit?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the Period vs. Star Name graph (bottom graph). Can you tell how long that planet's orbit is?</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong>Creating your own graph:</strong></h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon. What do you think those dots represent.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the y-axis attribute and the x-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from your graph's axis, click on the desired axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
