    <title>Bird Observations</title>
</head>
<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<body>
<p>This case table contains the raw data about what bird species were seen and when, per year. Check out the table and graph to see what you can learn about these birds.</p>
<h5>Examine the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what birds were seen on April 29, 2003?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. Hover over the highlighted dot, can you tell from the graph how many time the bird species was seen that day of the month?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>

<p>These observations were gathered by Fathom programmer Matt Litwin from April, 2003, to November, 2004.</p>
