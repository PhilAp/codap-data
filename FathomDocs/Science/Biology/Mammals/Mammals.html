<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<body>
<p>This case table gives you information about the sleeping habits of 62 different mammals species. Is there a relationship between how lon mammals sleep and how long they live?</p>
<ol>
    <li>Predation is an index of how likely the mammal is to be preyed upon.
        <ul>
            <li>1 = least likely to be preyed upon</li>
        <li>5 = most likely to be preyed upon</li>
        </ul>
        <br></li>
    <li>Exposure is an index of the how exposed the mammal is during sleep
        <ul>
            <li>1 = least exposed (e.g., sleeps in a well-protected den)</li>
            <li>5 = most exposed</li>
        </ul>
        <br/></li>
    <li>Danger is an index of how much danger the mammal faces from other animals. This index is based upon Predation and Exposure.
        <ul>
            <li>1 = least danger from other animals</li>
            <li>5 = most danger from other animals</li>
        </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Examine the table and graph:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out how many hours the cat dreamed while they were sleeping?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see? Can you tell from the table how long that species <em><strong>did not</strong></em> dream during their sleep?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. Can you tell how long that species slept?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph icon.</strong></li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
