<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>
<body>
<p>143 wild bears were anesthetized, and their bodies were measured and weighed. One goal of the study was to make a table (or perhaps a set of tables) for hunters, so they could estimate the weight of a bear based on other measurements. This would be used because in the forest it is easier to measure the length of a bear, for example, than it is to weigh it.</p>

<h5>Examine the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table</li>
    <li>Can you find out how much Berta weighed at 8 months old?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you seen the case table? Can you tell what the ID number of the bear you selected is?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. Can you tell what the age and the weight of the selected bear is?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph icon.</strong></li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
