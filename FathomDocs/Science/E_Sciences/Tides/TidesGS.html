    <title>The Tides of Maine and California</title>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<body>

<p>Using a tide and current predictor, we gathered data of the tide patterns of Alcatraz Island, in California, and Birch Island, in Maine. For the Alcatraz Island data, we used the tides of July 1, 2005, to August 25, 2005. For the Birch Island data, we used the tides of April 1, 2005 to May 26, 2005.</p>
