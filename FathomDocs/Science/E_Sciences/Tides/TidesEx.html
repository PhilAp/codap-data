<h2>Explore!</h2>

<h5>Check out the tables and graphs:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers in the case table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the height of the tides were at the 6:00 on 7/1/2005 at Alcatraz Island?</li>
    <li>Look in the right hand graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the case table above it? Can you tell what the hour of the day that height was recorded?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the same graph. What information can you gather from what is shown? What is the UTC time for that height?</li>
    <li>Do you see a difference in the tidal patterns? If so, describe how they are different. You may want to look at a map of where the two Islands are located to make a guess as to why this is.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
