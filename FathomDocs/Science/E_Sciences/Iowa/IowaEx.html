<p>This case table shows you the data from 1096 days of recording the weather in Iowa.</p>

<h5>Check out the table and graphs:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out how much total snowfall there was in the 3rd month of 1984?</li>
    <li>Look the graph on the right and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the other graph and the table? Can you tell from the table what the max temperature of that day was?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. Can you tell how much precipitation there was on that day?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
