<h5>Check out the table and graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you get from the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out the mg/L of CO2 there was in the 5th month of 1958?</li>
    <li>Look in the graph and click on one of the dots. What do you see in the table? Can you tell what month it was and the amount of CO2 in mg/L?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot? What was the season adjustment for that decimal year?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
