    <title>Moore's Law</title>
</head>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<body>

<p>In 1965, Gordan Moore (co-founder of the Intel Corporation) decided to predict the evolution of the size of transistors. He hypothesized that the number of transistors in a chip will just about double every 24 months. As the technology world expanded, he was proved correct.</p>

<p>This case table contains the number of transistors on major central processing units (CPUs) released by Intel Corporation.</p>

<h5>Attribute Key:</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>CPU</strong> = CPU name</li>
    <li><strong>Year</strong> = calendar year of release</li>
    <li><strong>Transistors</strong> = number of transistors</li>
    <li><strong>Since1970</strong> = number of years since 1970</li>
</ul>
