<h5>Check out the table and graph!</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Look at the column headers of the table. What information can you find in the table?</li>
    <li>Can you find out what the mid price of the 531i from BMW was?</li>
    <li>Click on one of the dots in the graph. What happens in the table?</li>
    <li>Hover over the highlighted dot in the graph. What information is shown? Can you tell what the manufacturer of the car was?</li>
    <li><strong>Think about it:</strong> &nbsp Are there examples of pairs of attributes that demonstrate strong or weak, positive or negative associations?</li>
    <li><strong>Think about it:</strong> &nbsp  Are any data values you think are unusual? Why are they unusual?</li>
</ul>

<h5>Create your own graph:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new graph by clicking on the <strong>Graph</strong> icon.</li>
    <li>Drag a column header, an attribute, to the graph y-axis. You should see an orange rectangle in the different areas of the graph that you can add attributes to.</li>
    <li>Drag another attribute to the x-axis. Is there a relationship between the x-axis attribute and the y-axis attribute?</li>
    <li>To remove an attribute from an axis, click on the axis label and select "Remove X" or "Remove Y."</li>
</ul>
