<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>Results from polls taken in 1993, 1994, 2000 and 2003 among students of the Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica.</p>

	<p>Attributes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>ID: student ID number. The first two (before 2000) or four (starting in 2000) digits indicate the year the student was admitted; the other five are (apparently) random but unique within each year.</li>
	<li>Province: province of origin (Costa Rica has seven provinces; ITCR is in Cartago). "Other" refers to foreign students. The polls in 1993 and 1994 didn't register this attribute.</li>
	<li>Major: program the student is enrolled in</li>
	<li>Sex: of the student..</li>
	<li>Height: height (as reported by the student), in centimeters</li>
	<li>Weight: weight (as reported by the student), in kilograms</li>
	<li>Admitted: year the student was admitted (redudant, as this info is implicit in the ID, but has a uniform format here).</li>
	<li>Polled: year in which the data was collected.</li>
</ul>

<p>Submitted by Luis Acuña, professor of Mathematics, Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. The data were collected by his Statistics students in various semesters as a field assignment. They are not trained pollers, so their samples may not be good representatives of the population</p>
