<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>For a group of 236 schoolchildren, a community collected the age (years), height (inches), and weight (pounds) of each child.</p>
<p>Using the data collected, what kind of information can you glean? What would you tell the school principal about this information?</p>
<p>This data comes from Lewis and Taylor (1967).</p>
