<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Do students who take standardized tests multiple times have an advantage over those who just take them once or twice?</p>

<p>Each of the cases in the collection represents a student taking a standardized test that has a mean score of 100 and a standard deviation of 20. Each student takes the test 6 times and each score is independent of the other 5 scores. (No learning!)</p>

<p>So, in this model, how many points are gained on the average, by taking the test a second time? How does that compare with taking it the 6th time?</p>
