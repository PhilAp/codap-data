<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>Here are the academic performance index scores for all 806 California high schools in 1999, plus much demographic data about the students and parents they serve.
</p>

<p><b>See if you can discover a relationship between a schools API score and one of it's demographic properties. </b>
<ol>
	<li>Drag an attribute from the case table to the x-axis of the graph in the bottom right corner. </li>
	<li>Drag the "api_99" attribute to the y-axis of the graph</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Try making a new graph and finding a new relationship by clicking on the graph button at the top of the window, and dragging attributes from the case table to the x and y axes. </b>
<ul>
	<li>One of the most interesting things to try is to add a legend  by dragging an attribute to the center of the graph. One could use this to see how the education levels of the parents related to the API of school where they kids went. Or use the percent response to gauge how representative the data are. </li>
</ul>
